# Questions

**Question #1**: Should we concern ourselves with the design of the meeting
space such as furniture options, aesthetic items, etc?

**Question #2**: What are the primary features of the web application that we are 
building?

**Question #3**: We have come up with a back-end system architecture for the web 
application. Any comments, concerns, or feedback?
- Back-end system architecture
    - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
    - Web Framework: Flask 1.1.1 (latest stable release)
    - Web Server: Nginx
    - Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI): Gunicorn
    - Database: MySQL

**Question #4**: To what extent will we be building tools for the analysis of the 
data we are gathering? A possible example: API for accessing certain data within
the database.

**Question #5**: We would prefer to work with development environments that match the
tech stack of our production server. Reasons for this are the following:
1. Avoid configuration-related issues that might stem from using Flask 
development server on our own machines.
2. Consistent development environment for all group members.
3. We would like to practice remote development (development environment on 
dedicated server as opposed to our own machines). This would give us the ability 
to SSH into each otherâ€™s development environments to potentially debug issues.
4. Our use of the production server environment would be the same as how each 
group member interacts with their development environment.

We would like to rent 4 VPSs (virtual private server) from a hosting provider 
to achieve this.

**Approximate Cost**: 4 (VPSs) * 4 (cost in dollars) * 4 (project duration in 
months) = $64.00.

We have experience renting servers for this purpose. We could set this all up 
on our own. How could we handle the financial aspect? 
(reimbursement with receipt)?
