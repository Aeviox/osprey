This week our team established and organized our communication channels (Slack, Google Drive, Team Meetings).
We decided on and installed technologies for the web application based on the resources you provided:
    operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
    web framework: Flask 1.1.1
    database: MySQL
    web server: Nginx
We secured a rack-mounted server in the Capstone laboratory which will serve as the production server.
We developed a "Hello World" prototype and began experimenting with streaming audio to the web application.
